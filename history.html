    <h1>History</h1>
      <h4>Beginning</h4>
        <p>Two days of good weather were forecast when the operation began on the night of September 16. Air attacks hit German airfields and positions along the path of the 1,567 air transports that followed, carrying the initial 20,000 parachute and glider troops (60 percent of the total infantry) with limited equipment and supplies. The 1st Airborne Division landed 6 miles (9.5 km) west of Arnhem and was soon fighting Nazi units near Oosterbeek. Its 1st Parachute Brigade moved toward Arnhem, but radio problems hindered communications. The 82nd Division came down near Nijmegan and soon secured several bridges and Groesbeek Heights. The 101st Division landed north of Eindhoven and within hours held four of five bridges.</p>
      <h4>30 Corps Advance</h4>
        <p>At 2:00 PM, XXX Corps started toward Eindhoven behind an artillery barrage but was soon delayed by German defenders. The surprised Germans in Field Marshal Walther Model’s Army Group B reacted quickly. He requested reinforcements and was given priority Luftwaffe support. German resistance stiffened by evening, and several bridges were blown up. Only 2nd Battalion, 1st Parachute Brigade reached Arnhem bridge. The battalion secured the north end and defeated German attempts to cross. The other two 1st Parachute battalions fought into Arnhem with heavy losses, but they never reached the bridge. At Nijmegan, the 82nd failed to take a key bridge but managed to turn back German counterattacks while the 101st and XXX Corps made contact. The next morning, XXX Corps elements linked with the 82nd and joined another unsuccessful effort to take Nijmegan bridge. Eventually, 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry secured the bridge, but XXX Corps tanks did not move forward for 18 hours.</p>
      <h4>Arnhem Collapses</h4>
        <p>Ahead, British airborne units were in considerable trouble. The 2nd Battalion at Arnhem had been overrun, and the encircled survivors of 1st Airborne Division at Oosterbeek grimly battled against increased German pressure. They withstood a series of heavy attacks during September 22–24. The delayed Polish airborne brigade finally landed but could not offer assistance. German counterattacks cut the road corridor, and highway sections changed hands several times. Allied leaders decided to abandon the advance and concentrate on defense. The rescue of the 1st Airborne Division survivors ended the operation.</p>
      <h4>Aftermath</h4>
        <p>A costly failure, Operation Market Garden remains a remarkable feat of arms. This is not because of its strategic ambition, but because of the determination and courage shown by Allied airborne troops and the units that tried to reach them. It also led to the liberation of a large part of the Netherlands at a time when many Dutch people were close to starvation.</p>
